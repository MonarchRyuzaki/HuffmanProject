Dear students,

A fine of Rs. 10000/ has been imposed on a few students those who were involved in damaging the properties of Hall-14. The notice for the same is attached herewith and is also available on the notice board of the Hostel for your information.

This is a warning to those students who are damaging the property of the hostel, we will take more strict action against them in future.

Furthermore, we request the other good students (those who are not damaging the hostel property) to bring the name of those students who are damaging the property of the hostel. Otherwise, a fine will be imposed on all students of Hall-14. This means that because of only a few students, all students have to pay a fine.

Finally, we request to all the students to consider the hostel as your home and stay peacefully without damaging your hostel/home properties. If you face any problem here, bring it to our notice and we will try to solve those problems to our best ability.

With best wishes,
Warden, Hall-14D
