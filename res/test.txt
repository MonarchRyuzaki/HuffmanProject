How to get desktop path in java
May 24, 2021 Abhinav0 comment
There two ways to achieve this:

By using user.home property
String path = System.getProperty("user.home") + File.separator +"Desktop";
By using FileSystemview
FileSystemView view = FileSystemView.getFileSystemView();
File file = view.getHomeDirectory();
String path = file.getPath();
